# Global Education & Scholarship Finder

## 📌 Project Overview
Global Education & Scholarship Finder is a Java-based application designed to help users search for universities, scholarships, and online courses worldwide. It integrates public APIs for university data and utilizes datasets for scholarships and online courses to provide users with comprehensive educational opportunities.

## 🎯 Features
- **Search for Universities**: Users can find universities by selecting a country.
- **Scholarship Finder**: Browse available scholarships based on predefined datasets.
- **Online Courses**: Explore online courses stored in datasets.
- **Real-time API Calls**: University details are retrieved from the Hipolabs Universities API.
- **Filtering & Sorting**: Users can filter results by country, institution, or scholarship type.
- **Error Handling**: Provides meaningful messages in case of API failures or incorrect user inputs.

## 🏗️ Project Components
### 1️⃣ University Search (API Integration)
- Uses **Hipolabs Universities API** to fetch university data.
- Allows users to search for universities by country.
- Displays university details such as name, website, and location.

### 2️⃣ Scholarship Finder (Dataset-Based)
- Uses a **predefined dataset** containing scholarship details.
- Users can search by country, field of study, or funding type.
- Displays relevant scholarships along with eligibility criteria and deadlines.

### 3️⃣ Online Courses (Dataset-Based)
- Stores online courses in a **local dataset**.
- Allows users to search for courses based on subjects and providers.
- Displays course details such as name, duration, and certification availability.

## 💻 Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **APIs**:
  - [Hipolabs Universities API](http://universities.hipolabs.com/) – Fetches university data.
- **Datasets**:
  - **Scholarship Dataset** – Contains details of scholarships.
  - **Online Course Dataset** – Lists available courses and providers.
- **Development Tools**:
  - **Visual Studio Code** (Code Editor)
  - **Postman** (API Testing & Debugging)
  - **GitHub** (Version Control & Collaboration)

## 🚀 Expected Results
✅ **Find universities** based on country selection.  
✅ **Retrieve real-time funding** opportunities from API/datasets.  
✅ **List scholarships** with eligibility details.  
✅ **Explore online courses** from stored datasets.  
✅ **Handle errors gracefully** with user-friendly messages.  

## 🏆 Concepts Applied
- **REST API Integration** (Fetching data from the Universities API)
- **JSON Parsing** (Handling API responses)
- **Data Structures** (ArrayList, HashMap for datasets)
- **Loops & Conditions** (For search & filtering logic)
- **Exception Handling** (Managing API failures & invalid inputs)
- **File Handling** (Reading datasets for scholarships and online courses)
